<h1> The Emerald Ash Borer</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The Emerald Ash Borer is an insect from eastern Russia, northern China, Japan, and Korea. It bores it&#8217;s way into ash trees hence the name Emerald Ash Borer</li>
<p>Ways to get rid of the Emerald Ash Borer&#58</p>
  <li>Soil Drench
The most common way to control the emerald ash borer is to drench the soil around the tree with diluted insecticide. The tree absorbs the insecticide through its roots, killing the beetles as they feed on the tissues of the trunk laced with insecticide. Many different products available in garden centers are effective against the emerald ash borer, but they all have the same active ingredient. This compound, imidacloprid, is the only chemical approved for use by homeowners, though professional landscape contractors and arborists have access to other, more powerful products.</li>
<li>Bark and Foliar Application of Insecticide
You can also spray ash trees with an insecticide or inject it into the bark. Homeowners can use products containing carbaryl and acephate as a spray treatment for the emerald ash borer. A hand-held pump sprayer or hose-end sprayer can be used to treat small ash trees, but a professional arborist or landscape contractor will have the specialized equipment to treat full-size trees. Trunk injections containing acephate can also be used to treat emerald ash borer. These inject the insecticide directly into the sap flow inside the bark of the ash tree, killing the beetles as they feed.</li>
<li>Application Methods
Apply soil drenches, foliar sprays and bark injections just before the beetles emerge from the trunks of infected trees in spring. One treatment is typically sufficient for young trees, but mature specimens can be treated again in the fall. As a preventative, treat trees in infested areas annually. Follow all directions on product labels for the correct dilution and application rates, as well as safety information. Avoid breathing the vapors of insecticides and wear rubber gloves and protective clothing to prevent skin contact.</li>
<li>Destroying Dead Wood
Ash trees need to be treated before serious infestation begins. After 20 percent of the canopy has died, the likelihood of saving the tree is greatly diminished. However, killing the beetles that remain in a dead tree is extremely important in preventing further spread of the pest. If an ash tree dies from an infestation of borers, it should be cut down in fall or winter and disposed of properly before the young beetles emerge in spring. The wood can be safely used for mulch if it is chipped down to 1-inch nuggets, or it can be burned.</li>
